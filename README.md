# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Song List 1.0

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: _Your Name_

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
`songs.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`songs_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used... it is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it
again.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?
