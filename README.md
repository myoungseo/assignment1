# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Song List 1.0

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: Choi Myeongseo

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
`songs.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`songs_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used... it is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it
again.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

   > I started the assignment on March 5th and worked on it for five days.

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

   > In Assignment 2, I plan to manage my time more effectively by setting a clear schedule and smaller goals. I will break down large problems into smaller ones and solve them step by step. Additionally, I will conduct frequent tests during development to avoid finding all errors at the last minute.
